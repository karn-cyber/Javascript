//let,const and var are the three variable types in JS
let a=10;
const b=20;
var c=30;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
// let is used because variables can be changed
// const is used because variables cannot be changed
// var is used because variables can be changed
//let is mostly used now because var can cause errors many a times.
